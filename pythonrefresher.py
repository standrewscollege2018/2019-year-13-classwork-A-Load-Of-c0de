# print() is a function
print("Hello world")
print(25)

# variables don't have a dollar sign!
# when naming we use snake_case, so no uppercase letter or symbols other than under underscore
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Smith"

# we can print variables or even text and variables
print(first_name)
print("Hello", first_name)
# using format() is a more elegant way of combining text and variables
print("Hello {} {}".format(first_name, last_name))


# To get user input we use rhe input() function. Input should be assigned to a variable.
